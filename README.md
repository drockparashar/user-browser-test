# ðŸ§  AI-Powered Browser Test Agent

This project demonstrates a **LLM + Browser automation prototype** that:
- Takes a **URL**, step-by-step **test instructions**, and an **expected output**
- Uses **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** to interpret the test case
- Executes the test steps using a **self-hosted Browser-Use agent**
- Returns a **Pass/Fail** verdict based on expected vs actual outcome

> Built as part of an AI intern evaluation task.
